## Project Overview

This project focuses on **automated testing** of key functionalities in the **Coursera website**, ensuring the websiteâ€™s reliability and user experience across different browsers and devices. 

The tests cover various areas, such as:
- **Login/Registration functionality**
- **Course Enrollment**
- **Payment Gateway**
- **Video Playback**


### Test Approach
- **End-to-end (E2E) Testing**: Using **Cypress** to automate user interactions.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Written in **Cucumber** with **Gherkin syntax** for better readability and collaboration.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tests the UI's responsiveness across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Cypress**: For automating the testing of web applications. Cypress helps in executing tests quickly and provides excellent debugging tools.
- **Cucumber**: For writing the test cases in **Gherkin syntax** that are easy to understand for both technical and non-technical team members.
- **JavaScript**: For writing custom commands and handling test scenarios.

- **Jira**: For bug tracking and project management.


## Test Plan

The main goal of this project is to ensure the core functionalities of the Coursera website are working seamlessly. Below are the test categories:

- **Functional Tests**: Testing critical user interactions like login, course search, enrollment, and payment.
- **UI/UX Tests**: Verifying layout and usability across devices.
- **Regression Tests**: Ensuring no existing functionality is broken after new updates.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensuring the platform is usable by people with disabilities, such as those using screen readers or keyboards for navigation.
- **Performance Tests**: Analyzing the page load times, especially under different network conditions and devices.
